# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
### Maria was informed from the school that there is evidence of academic dishonesty from Thomas High School ninth graders. The school board wants to replace all math and reading scores from Thomas High School with NaNs. After making these changes, the school wants to see if there were any changes to the overall grades.
